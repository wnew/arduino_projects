This is a repo for all my random arduino projects

//===================================
// All Project Ideas
//===================================

 Wireless Home Automation
=========================
Arduino controlled home automation, maybe with a RaspPi or Due and Ethernet
shield as the main control board. With wireless control from your android
phone.


 Electriciy Management System
==============================
Measuring and plotting household power usage. Using the arduino and current
sensors. Use this data to optimise the usage.


 Wireless Speaker Setup
========================
Centralised music system which can play music in any room wirelessly, contolled
via mobile phone. 
Cell Phone -> Wireless to network -> Music Server -> Stream music to different rooms (How?)


 Media PC attached to TV
=========================
Device running XBMC to manage media. (This is more of a RaspberryPi project)
Will also need to set up a remote control and a media server. 


 Arduino Controlled Headlamp
=============================
This would need to use a pro micro
Control brighness using some brightness sensor (LDR etc)
Monitor battery charge


 Arduino Controlled Fencing Box
================================
This is a basic fencing scoring box controlled by an Arduino. It is used to 
sense when a touch is made in a fencing bout.


 Arduino Controlled Switch Mode Power Supply
=============================================
I am sure this project has been done before but it would be a great project to
get your hands dirty with. The idea is to create a dual channle switch mode
power supply with much of the control done with an Adruino. It would be easy to
implement a display for the voltage and current settings and actual voltage
and current values. A basic relay board could be used and a couple of those
large heat sinks I have lying around. 

 
 Vehicle Tracker 
=================
This would use a GPS and a 3G/GSM module to track and report the location of a
vehicle. It would be useful to have a serperate battery to the vehicle battery
which also gets charged like the vehicle battery. You couls also include a 
magnetometer, gyro and accellerometer and capture these for analysis.


 Gyro Mouse
============
The idea here is to create give a standard mouse a few more axis of movement
using a gyro, accel and a magnetometer. This could be used for gaming or in 3D
design environments. Check out "Air Mouse"


 Full RC chain
===============
This project is meant to create a full chain, from remote control to the RF
link to the motor controller on a RC vehicle. It will use a Wii Nunchuk as the
controller, a pair of NRF24L01s as the RF link and an arduino with a motor
controller shield on the vehicle. There will also be an option to swap out the 
NRF modules for a standard 433MHz RF link. Or even swap out the nunchuk for a 
bluetooth link to your smart phone.


 Arduino Phone
===============
The idea here is to replace a fixed-line telephone with an arduino based device
which is connected to the home network and alowes phone calls to be make using
an android device over the fixed-line network. Thie would require a device that
can do ADC and DAC and can decode/encode DTMF. The Due could work for this but
more investigation is requried. 


 Arduino Oscilliscope
======================
Best to use a Due as is has a 12 bit ADC and runs at 84MHz as apposed to 10 bit
and 16MHz. We need some software for this as well, best do this in Python. 
This should be a fun project.
