This is a repo for all my random arduino projects








//===================================
// Project Ideas Still to Implement
//===================================

Electriciy management system
==============================
Measuring and plotting household power usage. Using the arduino and current sensors.
Using this data to optimise the usage.


Wireless speaker setup
========================
Centralised music system which can play music in any room wirelessly, contolled via mobile phone.
Cell Phone -> Wireless to network -> Music Server -> Stream music to different rooms (How?)


Media PC attached to TV
=========================
Device running XBMC to manage media. (This is more of a RaspberryPi project)


Arduino Controlled Headlamp
=============================
This would need to use a pro micro
Control brighness using a brightness sensor (LDR etc)
Monitor battery charge



Arduino Controlled Fencing Box
================================



Arduino Controlled Switch Mode Power Supply
=============================================
