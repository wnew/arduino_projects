 Description
=============
The intent of this project is to create a mouse that uses a gyroscope,
accellerometer and a magnetometer to add more axis of motion to a conventional
mouse. The idea is to modify a standard optical mouse and to add an arduino
pro micro to it. This would aid designers and gamers providing them additional
interfaces and funtionality.


============
 Pro Micro
============
The pro micro can function as a keyboard or a mouse and issue commands to the
pc as such it makes sense that the arduino forwards on all the standard mouse
commands and adds the gyro/accel/mag commands.


===============
 Wireless link
===============
This feature could be implemented in the future


======================
 Implementation Steps
======================
1. Integrate gyro with pro micro and move mouse/send keyboard key presses
2. Route standard mouse data via pro micro
