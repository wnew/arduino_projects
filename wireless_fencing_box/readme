 Arduino Controlled Wireless Fencing Box

 Description
=============
This project impements a wireless fencing scoring box using the HC-05 bluetooth
modules for comms between the fencers and a control box.

This is a more complex project then the basic fencing scoring box. As it will
require syncronisation between the 2 wireless devices. The plan is to use the 4
HC-05 bluetooth modules (1 for each fencer and 2 on the control box). They will
need to be synced every minute or so. The control box will need 2 hardware
serial interfaces so the processor wont have to manage any software serial
buffers. either the Mega or the Due would be able to do this. The fencers
modules will use a Pro Micro or Pro Mini and the HC-05. Need to test if we can
handle 2 bluetooth modules on a arduino, that the bluetooth link is still good
over 10m and that the syncronisation is good enough for millisecond accuracy.

 Wireless Comms
================
The plan is to use the HC-05 Bluetooth module for comms between the fencers
and the control box. A few things still need to be tested. 1. The range of the
bluetooth needs to be better then 10m and, as there are 2 connections, we need
to make sure that there is no interference between the 2. If the HC-05 doesnt
meet these requirements there are other options like the NRF24L01 modules.


======================
 Implementation Steps
======================
1. Test indoor range of HC-05
2. Test for collisions with multiple HC-05 connections
3. Test syncronisation of remote devices
