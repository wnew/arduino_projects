 Description
=============
This project is an arduino based soil moisture controller and logger. It logs
the soil moisture to an SD card and opens a solenoid to allow watering of the
soil if the moisture drops below a certain threshold. The moisture values and
the current state of the solenoid are displayed on either a Nokia 5510 LCD or
a 2x16 LCD.
