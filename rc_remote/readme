=============
 Description
=============
This repo stores the details and code of the implementation of a full remote
control chaini for a car, it is based on the arduino platform. This includes
every thing from the remote control, the wireless link and the motor driver
control.  

================
 Remote Control
================
The remote control is a Wii Nunchuch, which has a 2 axis joystick, a gyroscope
and 2 push buttons. This design will only use the joystick for control as the 
car only needs forward/backward and left/right which is perfect for just the
joystck.

===============
 Wireless link
===============
The aim is to support both the NRF24L01 devices and the more basic 433MHz
reciever and transmitter modules.

==================
 Motor Controller
==================
The motor controller shield is the Adafruit v1 motor controller shield based
on the L293D IC. This shield supports stepper motors, servos and dc motors.


1. Nunchuck ---> Arduino
2. Arduino  ---> Motor Shield       ---> Motor
3. Arduino  ---> NRF -)))  (((- NRF ---> Arduino
4. Nunchuck ---> Arduino            ---> Motor Shield       ---> Motors
5. Nunchuck ---> Arduino            ---> NRF -)))  (((- NRF ---> Arduino ---> Motor Shield ---> Motors
5. Nunchuck ---> Arduino            ---> 433MHz Tran -)))  (((- 433MHz Recv                ---> Arduino ---> Motor Shield ---> Motors


1. Get the Nunchuck outputs and print to the serial port
2. Get the motor shield working with motors
3. Get the wireless link working
4. Integrate the nunchuck and the motor shield
5. Integrate the wireless link
